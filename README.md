# Certificate Generation :

## Overview

The Certificate Generation project is a Streamlit application designed to generate certificates by adding names to a certificate template. Users can upload a list of names from a text file, provide coordinates for placing the names on the certificate, and customize the text color.

## Installation

To run the Certificate Generation application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
     
2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Install the required dependencies:

4. Run the Streamlit application:

The application will be accessible at [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) by default.

## Python Libraries

The following Python libraries are used in this project:

- **OpenCV (cv2):**
OpenCV is employed for image processing tasks, including reading, manipulating, and adding text to certificate templates.

- **NumPy (numpy):**
NumPy is utilized for numerical operations and array handling, providing efficient data structures for image processing tasks.

- **Pillow (PIL):**
Pillow, the Python Imaging Library, is used for image opening, conversion, and saving, enhancing image handling capabilities.

- **Streamlit (streamlit):**
Streamlit is the framework for creating web applications, enabling the creation of a user-friendly certificate generation interface.

- **Base64 (base64):**
Base64 is employed for encoding and decoding binary data, facilitating the conversion of images into a format suitable for web display.

- **BytesIO (BytesIO):**
BytesIO is used for in-memory file manipulation, allowing seamless processing of image data without the need for physical files.

## User Guide

1. Open the Streamlit application in a web browser.
2. Upload a text file (.txt) containing a list of names.
3. Provide the desired coordinates (X and Y) and RGB color code for text customization.
4. Upload a certificate template image.
5. Click the "Generate Certificates" button to process the names and generate certificates.
6. Download the generated certificates.
